A colaboration with the wonderful [Lucy Pullen](http://www.iamthevariable.com/) this project aimed to explore the vast empty spaces between the stars in our local solar neighborhood. 100 voronoi volumes where generated from the 100 nearest starts to the Sun. Each of these volumes represented the space closer to a specific star then any other. The volumes then are a representation not of the star but the spaces between them, shifting focus from the usual representaion of space to its negatuve. 

These volumes where 3D printed in various colours and aranged on courgated meatal. They where exhibited at Bushwick open stuidos 2016 where viewers where encouraged to pick up and play with the objects and to try and reconstruct the continous region of space they represent when assembeled together.
