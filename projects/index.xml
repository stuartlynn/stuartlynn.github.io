      <description>A colaboration with the wonderful Adriene Lilly &amp;ldquo;Space of an Eye&amp;rdquo; combines an interactive experince with Adrienes soundscape focusing on an experince of eye surgery.
The listerner aproatches the peice and puts on headphones through which they hear a recount of glaucoma surgery along with other ambient sounds and medical/religuous/biological takes of the eye.
Space of an Eye collab w/ @Stuart_Lynn part of #seekingspace in Bushwick. Interactive sounds about eyes, surgery, fish.</description>

      <description>A colaboration with the wonderful Lucy Pullen this project aimed to explore the vast empty spaces between the stars in our local solar neighborhood. 100 voronoi volumes where generated from the 100 nearest starts to the Sun. Each of these volumes represented the space closer to a specific star then any other. The volumes then are a representation not of the star but the spaces between them, shifting focus from the usual representaion of space to its negatuve.</description>

      <description>SETILive was a project funded by the TED prize to build a crowd sourcing platform to hunt for signals in data from the Allen Telescope that might be other than terrestrial in origin. This was done by showing them frequency time plots in three bands and asking them to identify bright coherent lines that appeared in each and that where diagonal in nature.
This system operated in real time as the telescope was observing.</description>

      <description>The redshift mirror was a project built during the Dot Astronomy conference to try and visualise the resdhift or blueshift as objects in the universe move away or towards us  #dotastro redshift demonstration

It uses a Kinect camera to monitor a scene and estimates the velocity of objects in the scene either towards or away from the camera by diffing frames.</description>
